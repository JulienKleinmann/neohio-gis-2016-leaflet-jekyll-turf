This repo contains examples from the presentation at the Northeast Ohio GIS Symposium talk on Leaflet, Jekyll and TurfJS.

To view the examples, either run jekyll serve in the jekyll-leaflet-turf folder, or just view the html files in the jekyll-leaflet-turf/_site/examples folder. You will want to view these with Firefox if you are not running a local web server.
